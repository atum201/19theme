## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/atum201/19theme/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three
    vả a = 100;

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
    

### Markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/atum201/19theme/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:
dsada
    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
